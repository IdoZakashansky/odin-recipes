# odin-recipes
in this project I had to use a couple of skills that I picked up over the last couple of days.
those skills can be divided to 2 main groups, HTML/coding related staff and Git related staff.
HTML:
-images
-ordered and unordered lists
-links
-headings
-paragraphs
Git:
-create a git repository
-commit and push files
-write commit messages
